## Description

We want to create a Rendering demo which showcases one scene (or very similar looking scenes) in all 4 seasons. The base theme of the scene should be in an Japanese/Chinese style. E.g temples, laterns, Trees, nature. 
The transition between seasons will be hidden by either the camera movement itself (blocking scene with one object) or just a fade in black animation. 
For music a general background music is planned that fits the scene.
